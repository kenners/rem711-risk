% The student should address their own impending deployment to a remote environment and draw up a plan to provide optimal healthcare to the at risk population.  This does not need to address every hazard posed by the environment (although the range of hazards faced should be briefly described) but should cover at least three separate areas.

% In order to achieve this you will need to:

%   Describe the main areas of hazard to the expedition resulting from the environment, expedition activities or local populace. Consider also the specific interpersonal challenges of a lone practitioner caring for a group of which they are a part.  Choose areas that will be addressed with a rationale as to why they form the focus of the work.

%   Identify levels of risk associated with each hazard and describe techniques described in the literature to mitigate them.

%   Demonstrate an understanding of the harms likely to result from these hazards, and give an evidence-based strategy for managing them in the remote environment.

%   Identify the limitations of “standard” management of these conditions imposed by the constraints of the expedition (Transport, access to additional healthcare resources, portability, supply, cost etc).  Synthesize plans to provide optimal management within these limits.

%   Draw these plans together to provide kit lists, training objectives, procedures, strategies etc that demonstrate the optimal management of these hazards within your chosen environment.

%   Conclude with a summary of the key areas you need to address to keep your expedition safe from these hazards, highlighting how this may be different from conventional NHS practice.

In October 2013, the British Antarctic Survey will begin its summer operations and resupply of Rothera Research Station, involving the transport of over a hundred personnel to Antarctica and a steady ramp up in scientific activities for the Austral summer. Personnel deploy to the continent for a variety of durations: from a mythical ``long-weekend in Rothera'' to an 18 month overwintering tour.

The Antarctic environment is frequently hostile and presents many hazards alien to the UK. Moreover, the ability to manage these hazards is severely constrained due to the limited infrastructure and personnel available. These limitations may require unorthodox or unusual solutions to be employed when devising a pragmatic medical plan.

Medical cover is provided by a single Medical Officer (MO), assisted by several Advanced First Aiders -- trained in part by the MO -- and all personnel have basic First Aid training prior to deployment. During the Austral summer, there is an overlap period of several months between incoming and outgoing MOs whereby two doctors may be available on site. Further medical support is rendered by a comprehensive telemedicine service by the British Antarctic Survey Medical Unit (BASMU), based in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK. BASMU also trains MOs prior to deployment, which fosters a close working relationship between MOs and clinicians who will potentially be providing telemedicine support.

This medical plan documents the risk assessment that has been undertaken to identify the range of risks presented by Antarctic operations. Whilst addressing general considerations, hazards identified as taking the greatest importance will be discussed comprehensively, including strategies for avoidance and control of the encountered risks, and a response plan in the event of harm occurring.
