\maketitle

% The student should address their own impending deployment to a remote environment and draw up a plan to provide optimal healthcare to the at risk population.  This does not need to address every hazard posed by the environment (although the range of hazards faced should be briefly described) but should cover at least three separate areas.

% In order to achieve this you will need to:

%   Describe the main areas of hazard to the expedition resulting from the environment, expedition activities or local populace. Consider also the specific interpersonal challenges of a lone practitioner caring for a group of which they are a part.  Choose areas that will be addressed with a rationale as to why they form the focus of the work.

%   Identify levels of risk associated with each hazard and describe techniques described in the literature to mitigate them.

%   Demonstrate an understanding of the harms likely to result from these hazards, and give an evidence-based strategy for managing them in the remote environment.

%   Identify the limitations of “standard” management of these conditions imposed by the constraints of the expedition (Transport, access to additional healthcare resources, portability, supply, cost etc).  Synthesize plans to provide optimal management within these limits.

%   Draw these plans together to provide kit lists, training objectives, procedures, strategies etc that demonstrate the optimal management of these hazards within your chosen environment.

%   Conclude with a summary of the key areas you need to address to keep your expedition safe from these hazards, highlighting how this may be different from conventional NHS practice.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{quote}
Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Poor Performance. \\
\em British Army adage
\end{quote}

In October 2013, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will begin its summer operations and resupply of Rothera Research Station, involving the transport of over a hundred personnel to Antarctica and a steady ramp up in scientific activities for the Austral summer. Personnel deploy to the continent for a variety of durations: from a mythical ``long-weekend in Rothera'' to an 18 month overwintering tour.

The Antarctic environment is frequently hostile and presents many hazards alien to the UK. Moreover, the ability to manage these hazards is severely constrained due to the limited infrastructure and personnel available. These limitations may require unorthodox or unusual solutions to be employed when devising a pragmatic medical plan.

This medical plan documents the risk assessment that has been undertaken to identify the range of risks presented by Antarctic operations. Whilst addressing general considerations, hazards identified as taking the greatest importance will be discussed comprehensively, including strategies for avoidance and control of the encountered risks, and a response plan in the event of harm occurring.

\section{Situation Briefing}

\subsection{Environment}

Rothera research station was established in 1975 and is located at 67°34'S, 68°08'W on Adelaide Island on the Antarctic peninsula. It lies 1,900km south of the Falkland Isles and 1,500km south-east of Cape Horn. The terrain surrounding Rothera is mountainous with peaks in exceeding 2,500m and is also heavily glaciated. Temperatures range from around 0 -- 5ºC during summer to between -5ºC and -20ºC in winter, with gales and high winds being commonplace. Lying within the Antarctic circle, Rothera experiences several weeks without sunlight during the winter.

The station comprises of several low buildings, including accommodation facilities, workshops, laboratories, and a control tower. Air operations are facilitated by a hangar, fuel depot, and 900m long runway and apron in close proximity to accommodation buildings. As a coastal station, Rothera also has a wharf permitting resupply by ship.

Rothera is resupplied by both sea and air. Cargo is predominantly transported by sea on one of two calls per season by BAS-operated vessels, whilst personnel movements usually occur by air on Dash-7 or Twin Otter aircraft.

\subsection{Population}

As the largest research station operated by BAS, the summer population approaches 130 staff, whilst for the 2013-14 season approximately 20 people are expected to overwinter. Personnel ages range from early twenties through to early sixties. There is a significant gender skew with a 4:1 male:female ratio amongst overwintering staff. All personnel are prescreened prior to deployment which includes both medical and dental assessment.

\subsection{Activities}

 Scientific research consists mainly of marine biology, geology, glaciology and meteorology, with the majority of the work conducted during the Austral summer.

In addition to conducting research on and around station, Rothera also serves as a logistics hub for UK science parties and partner nations operating in the deep field, with personnel transiting Rothera either by air or by overland travel on snowmobile or snowcat. Deep field parties are geographically and temporally remote -- frequently hundreds kilometres and several hours flight time away.

In addition to local and deep field operations, two forward operating bases fall under Rothera's medical cover. Fossil Bluff (71°20'S, 68°17'W) and Sky-Blu (74°51'S, 71°34'W) are two logistics facilities around 90 minutes and 3 hours flight time from Rothera respectively. As summer-only stations, their role is to support deep field operations and have only limited personnel on site living in pyramid tents. Communication with Rothera is conducted via radio, and there are comprehensive medical kits at both sites.

\subsection{Medical Provision}

\subsubsection{Primary}

Medical cover on station is provided by a single Medical Officer (MO), assisted by several Advanced First Aiders -- trained in part by the MO -- and all personnel have basic First Aid training prior to deployment. During the Austral summer, there is an overlap period of several months between incoming and outgoing MOs whereby two doctors may be available on site.

Further medical support is rendered by a comprehensive telemedicine service by the British Antarctic Survey Medical Unit (BASMU), based in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK. BASMU also trains MOs prior to deployment, which fosters a close working relationship between MOs and clinicians who will potentially be providing telemedicine support.

The medical bay at Rothera is physically small but well-provisioned, including plain film radiology, full anaesthetic capability, and \emph{in extremis}, general surgical capability.

\subsubsection{Secondary}

The closest secondary medical care facility is Clinica Magallanes\cite{Anonymous:TgM8hVWD} in Punta Arenas, Chile, and is 1,600km and 4.5 hours flight time away by Dash-7 aircraft. It is a private tertiary referral centre for the region, providing all major medical and surgical specialities, including neurosurgery. It has both CT and MRI imaging available onsite.

An alternative is Kind Edward VII Memorial Hospital in Stanley, Falkland Islands. It offers 17 acute beds, with an emergency department, dental services, a single theatre, and 2 ITU beds.\cite{Anonymous:qFBtPcmx} Whilst it can provide plain film radiology it has no CT scanner. It is a proven evacuation route, having previously received medivacs from Rothera, but it is further away than Punta (1,900km), incurring an additional hour's flight time (5.5 hours). Moreover, Punta offers a more comprehensive range of facilities so should be the preferred evacuation route.

Medical evacuation normally takes place by air, using Dash-7 aircraft which have a pressurised cabin. However, aircraft are not normally stationed at Rothera during winter, and BASMU maintains a policy of not undertaking evacuations during this period due to the risks presented by inclement weather. An alternative method is by ship, and casualties have previously been evacuated under exceptional circumstances during winter via this route. It should be stressed that evacuation may be delayed for a considerable period in both summer and winter owing to poor conditions.

\section{Risk Assessment}

Risk is an integral part of every challenging human endeavour. Indeed, it often contributes to the appeal of undertaking exigent activity itself. When devising a medical plan, the process of logically assessing likely hazards and their risk harm is a valuable planning tool. This plan employs a qualitative risk assessment model, and defines a hazard as any agent that may cause harm, whereas risk may be understood as a qualitative description of the composite of the severity of the harm and its likelihood in occurring.\cite{TheNationalPatientSafetyAgency:2007ud}

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) describes five steps\cite{HSE:2012tp} in the process of risk assessment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the hazards
    \item Decide who might be harmed and how
    \item Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions
    \item Record the findings and implement them
    \item Review the assessment and update as necessary
\end{enumerate}

Using this model, a brief qualitative risk assessment for Rothera station is undertaken in Appendix A.

When a risk is identified, four techniques may be employed to manage it:

\begin{description}
    \item[Avoidance] aims to reduce the \emph{probability} of risk i.e. reducing the likelihood of a harm occurring -- preferably to zero. Whilst effective, taken to an extreme it entails not performing the activity that exposes people to the hazard which is often impractical.
    \item[Mitigation] aims to reduce the \emph{severity} of a risk i.e. reducing the harm created when a risk occurs. It is useful in situations where risk is sizeable and cannot be easily avoided.
    \item[Transference] shifts or shares the harm of a risk when it occurs to a third party. Transferring risk is most appropriate for situations where the harm of a risk can be clearly measured and fully addressed e.g. duplicating mission-critical equipment in case of its loss.
    \item[Acceptance] is the strategy of actively deciding that one will accept the harm of a risk should it occur and planning appropriately to manage the consequences. Clearly the potential gains should heavily outweigh the harm, so acceptance is best reserved for when the severity of harm is significantly smaller than the cost of avoiding, mitigating, or transferring the risk.
\end{description}

Whilst a fully comprehensive risk assessment for Rothera is beyond the scope of this medical plan, three hazards have been identified that merit further discussion below.

\section{Challenges as the Lone Practitioner}

\begin{quote}
Physician, heal thyself. \\
\em Luke 4:23
\end{quote}

An inherent risk to Rothera is that for a significant proportion of the year there is a single medical provider. As a single point of failure, if the MO is unwell or injured, there is no other doctor to treat him. This risk may be mitigated by training advanced first aiders to a level where they can treat common conditions, and telemedicine support from BASMU transfers some of this risk. Furthermore, being aware of the risk, the MO may elect to avoid very high risk activities.

The doctor-patient relationship may also be altered when treating a colleague or friend, as professional judgement may be clouded by interpersonal issues. If there is a breakdown in friendship or working relationship, it may be difficult for an MO to act impartially. The facility to discuss issues with the BASMU telemedicine service provides a valuable sounding board for the MO in this context.

Moreover, the MO's actions may be scrutinised with disproportionate significance by other personnel, so the MO should be assiduously impartial to maintain their approachability and neutrality.

There is also a risk of developing a romantic relationship with patients in an isolated and confined environment, although this is discouraged. The GMC's guidance is unequivocal: ``You must not pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship with a current patient.''\cite{Anonymous:2013wj,Anonymous:2013ve}

Confidentiality may also present a challenge, as the MO has a duty of care to not only the patient but to the station as a whole. There are therefore circumstances where the MO may need to breach confidentiality to the Base Commander to ensure the safety of others. Additionally, if a patient requires secondary medical care, logistical arrangements would also require limited disclosure of confidential information. Whenever the MO is disclosing confidential information, he should seek permission from the patient, explaining why and what is being disclosed.\cite{Anonymous:2013ta}

Tightly coupled to this issue is that the majority of the MO's work occurs in private, shielded from the rest of the station. Not only may this give rise to the impression of idleness by the MO, this situation also means the MO does not routinely have colleagues to vent or casually discuss confidences with -- often a key coping mechanism. Encouraging regular telephone contact with BASMU and other MOs on different stations is one mitigation strategy.
